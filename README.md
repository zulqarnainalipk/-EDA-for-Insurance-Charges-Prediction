# 📚 EDA Insurance Charges Prediction

## Introduction
This notebook aims to predict insurance charges using a linear regression model based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, etc. The dataset contains historical data of an organization's customers, including their characteristics and corresponding insurance charges.

## Installation
1. **Install Required Libraries**: Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```

## Notebook Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- **`insurance_data.csv`**: The dataset is loaded using pandas to analyze and predict insurance charges.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the shape, null values, information, duplicates, statistics, and outliers in the dataset.
- Visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms and box plots.
- Use pair plots to visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Encode categorical variables like smoking status using label encoding.
- Rescale numerical features using standardization.

### 4. Feature Selection
- Explore correlations between features and the target variable.
- Use correlation matrix and heatmap to identify relationships between features.

### 5. Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a linear regression model on the training data.
- Make predictions on the testing data using the trained model.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Calculate R-squared score, mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error to evaluate the model's performance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook and dataset.
2. Install the required libraries using the provided command.
3. Run the notebook step by step to explore the dataset, build the model, and evaluate its performance.
